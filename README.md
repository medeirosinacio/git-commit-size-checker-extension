# Git Commit Size Checker | Extension

This is a beta version of the Git Commit Size Checker browser extension that currently supports GitHub. It is available
for download on the Chrome Store.

The extension is designed to help developers follow good Git practices by ensuring that their commit messages do not
exceed 72 characters. This helps make commit messages easier to read and understand, particularly in cases where a long
message might be truncated.

Currently, the extension only works on the GitHub platform. Support for other platforms will be added in the future.

## Installation

The extension can be installed from the Chrome Store by navigating to the extension page and clicking the "Add to
Chrome" button.

## Usage

Once installed, the extension will automatically validate commit messages on GitHub, providing real-time feedback to
help ensure that the message length does not exceed 72 characters. The extension works by dynamically adding an error
message below the commit message input field.
